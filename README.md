# DCL Exercise Tool

A tool for automatically populating Canvas courses with DataCamp Light exercises from GitHub repositories.

## Overview

The DCL Exercise Tool helps educators easily integrate DataCamp Light coding exercises into their Canvas LMS courses. The tool:

1. Takes a GitHub repository URL containing Python exercise files
2. Parses metadata from these files to determine their target Canvas pages and placement
3. Automatically updates the corresponding Canvas pages with embedded DataCamp Light exercises

## Features

- Simple web UI for configuring Canvas and GitHub integration
- Subdirectory selection from GitHub repositories
- Automatic parsing of Python exercise files with metadata blocks
- Canvas page updating with proper DataCamp Light embed codes
- Error handling with options to continue or abort processing
- Detailed reporting on the success or failure of each exercise update

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dcl-exercise-tool.git

# Navigate into the project
cd dcl-exercise-tool

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
